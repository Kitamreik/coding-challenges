    "   print(o)  # Output: 6\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unpacking lists:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [7, 8, 9]\n",
    "   p, q, r = numbers\n",
    "   print(p)  # Output: 7\n",
    "   print(q)  # Output: 8\n",
    "   print(r)  # Output: 9\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mixing different data types:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name, age, is_student = \"Alice\", 23, True\n",
    "   print(name)       # Output: Alice\n",
    "   print(age)        # Output: 23\n",
    "   print(is_student) # Output: True\n",

    "\n",
    "## MAX/MIN\n",
    "The `max` function in Python returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. It can be used with various data types, such as numbers, strings, and tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For an iterable:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   max(iterable, *[, key, default])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **For two or more arguments:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   max(arg1, arg2, *args[, key])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "- **iterable**: An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) whose largest item is to be found.\n",
    "- **arg1, arg2, *args**: Two or more arguments among which the largest value is to be found.\n",
    "- **key** (optional): A function that serves as a key for the comparison.\n",
    "- **default** (optional): The default value to return if the iterable is empty. This is only valid when using an iterable.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "sorted(iterable, *, key=None, reverse=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **iterable**: The sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) or collection (e.g., dictionary, set) to be sorted.\n",
    "- **key** (optional): A function that serves as a key for the sort comparison. For example, `key=str.lower` would perform a case-insensitive sort of strings.\n",
    "- **reverse** (optional): A boolean value. If `True`, the sorted list is reversed (or sorted in descending order).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sorting in descending order:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\n",
    "   sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)\n",

    "## HOW TO CALCULATE THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF A NUMBER\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#In Python, you can calculate the absolute value of a number using the built-in `abs` function. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, without considering its direction (i.e., it's always a non-negative number).\n",
    "\n",
    "abs(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **number**: The number for which you want to find the absolute value. This can be an integer, a floating-point number, or a complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute value of the given number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absolute value of an integer:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = abs(-5)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Absolute value of a floating-point number:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = abs(-3.14)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 3.14\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Absolute value of a positive number:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = abs(42)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 42\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Absolute value of a complex number:**\n",
    "   The absolute value of a complex number is its magnitude, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = abs(3 + 4j)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 5.0 (since sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5)\n",

    "## HOW TO MAKE A LIST\n",
    "Lists in Python are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. You can create a list by enclosing values in square brackets [], separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "names = [\"Faizan\", \"Yasin\", \"John\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, my_list contains integers, while names is a list of strings. Lists are versatile and can hold items of different types, including other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are also versatile and can be modified in a variety of ways, such as adding, removing, or changing items.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Adding items\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the end\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing items\n",
    "my_list.remove(2)  # Removes the first occurrence of 2\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing and modifying items\n",
    "my_list[0] = 10  # Changes the first item\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 3, 4]\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Iterating over a range of numbers\n",
    "for i in range(1, 4):  # Will iterate from 1 to 3\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterating over a string\n",
    "for char in \"Hello\":\n",
    "    print(char)\n",
    "\n",
    "#While loops can be used for repeated actions until a condition is no longer true. You can also use break to exit a loop early.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using break to exit a loop\n",
    "i = 1\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",

    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## DICTIONARIES\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable, and does not allow duplicates. Here's how you can create a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_info = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Faizan\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 23,\n",
    "    \"city\": \"New York\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "You can access the values by referring to their keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(user_info[\"name\"])  # Output: Faizan\n",
    "Dictionaries are flexible and can have keys and values added, modified, or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding a new key-value pair\n",
    "user_info[\"country\"] = \"USA\"\n",
    "print(user_info) # {'name': 'Faizan', 'age': 23, 'city': 'New York', 'country': 'USA'}\n",
