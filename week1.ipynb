    "- You Identified the Solution Well\n",
    "You correctly identified the need for a flag variable (in_section) to track 7-8 sections, which was crucial for the solution. Your implementation of the main logic using if-elif statements was also on point.\n",
    "- You Implemented Code Accurately\n",
    "Your final solution correctly handled all test cases, demonstrating a good understanding of the problem requirements. You successfully implemented the logic to ignore numbers between 7 and 8.\n",
    "- You Structured Your Plan and Thought Process\n",
    "Your code was well-structured with clear variable names like total_sum and in_section. The logic flow was easy to follow, with each condition clearly separated in the if-elif structure."
